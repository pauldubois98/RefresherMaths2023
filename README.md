# Refresher Maths 2023
## Master Data Science and Buisness Analyctics @ ESSEC - CentraleSup√©lec

Sources for the refresher maths course taught at the ESSEC buisness school september 2023.

The content for the first two sessions can be found here:

After discussion with the students, the content had to evolve to better fit their needs.
Hence, the last six sessions are exercise based.

The exercises can be found here:
