# Math Refresher 2023

### Assumed to be known

- 4 operations (+,-,\*,/)
- integer vs rational vs decimal

## Course Content:

- Sets
  - sets of numbers ($\N$, $\Z$, $\R$, $\Q$)
  - complex sets (with $\{ \}$)
  - extreme values ($\min$,$\max$ vs $\sup$,$\inf$)
- Modular arithmetic
  - with $k \in \Z$
  - with tables
- Functions and Sequences
  - functions def
  - example: $f: x \to x^2$, $g: x \to \sqrt{x}$, 
  - sequences def: general formula & recursive formula
  - example: $u_n = n^3-5n^2$
- Essence of proofs
  - proof: assumption => conclusion
  - direct with $n \geq 0 \implies 2n \geq 4n$
  - cases split with $n \equiv n^2 \mod 2$
  - contradiction with $\sqrt{2} \not \in \Q$
  - induction with $u_0 = 2, u_{n+1} = \frac{u_n+1}{2} \implies u_n>1$
